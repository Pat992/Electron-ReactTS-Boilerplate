This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ReactTS
inside the ./src folder you can write your reactTS code.

## electron
feel free to write your electron-code wherever.
but I would advise to write it inside the ./electron folder, to keep the project cleaner

## Icon
Create an ./icon folder and inside there use your own icon for the program.
either call it "logo.ico" or rename it inside the build in package.json

## Scripts
Start the application with:
### `npm start`

Build installer (Make sure to have the latest version of NodeJS):
### `npm run-script build`
