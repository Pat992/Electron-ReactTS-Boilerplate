## ReactTS
inside the ./src folder you can write your reactTS code.

## electron
feel free to write your electron-code wherever.
but it would look cleaner if written inside the ./electron folder

In the project directory, you can run:

either call it "logo.ico" or rename it inside the build in package.json

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Build installer with (Make sure to have the latest version of NodeJS):
### `npm run-script build`
